\usage{
sf_get_job_records_bulk(
  job_id,
  api_type = c("Bulk 1.0", "Bulk 2.0"),
  record_types = c("successfulResults", "failedResults", "unprocessedRecords"),
  combine_record_types = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{job_id}{\code{character}; the Salesforce Id assigned to a submitted job as
returned by \link{sf_create_job_bulk}. It will start with \code{"750"}.}

\item{api_type}{\code{character}; one of \code{"REST"}, \code{"SOAP"},
\code{"Bulk 1.0"}, or \code{"Bulk 2.0"} indicating which API to use when
making the request.}

\item{record_types}{\code{character}; one or more types of records to retrieve
from the results of running the specified job}

\item{combine_record_types}{\code{logical}; indicating for Bulk 2.0 jobs whether the
successfulResults, failedResults, and unprocessedRecords should be stacked
together by binding the rows}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical}; an indicator of whether to print additional
detail for each API call, which is useful for debugging. More specifically, when
set to \code{TRUE} the URL, header, and body will be printed for each request,

\value{
A \code{tbl_df} or \code{list} of \code{tbl_df}, formatted by Salesforce,

}
\description{
This function returns detailed (row-level) information on a job
which has already been submitted completed (successfully or not).

With Bulk 2.0 the order of records in the response is not guaranteed to
match the ordering of records in the original job data.
