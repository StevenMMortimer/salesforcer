\usage{
sf_get_dashboard_results(
  dashboard_id,
  running_user = NULL,
  dashboard_filters = c(character(0))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dashboard_id}{\code{character}; the Salesforce Id assigned to a created
dashboard. It will start with \code{"01Z"}.}

\item{running_user}{\code{character}; the Salesforce Id that should be assigned
as the runner of the job. This should be from a User record (i.e. the Id will
start with "005"). Note that this will throw an error if the User is not
allowed to change the running User, or if the selected running User is invalid.}

\item{dashboard_filters}{\code{character}; Dashboard results are always unfiltered, unless you
have specified filter parameters in your request. Use this argument to include
up to three optional filter Ids. You can obtain the list of defined filter Ids
from the dashboard metadata using \link{sf_dashboard_describe}.}
