While writing the {salesforcer} package we were keenly aware that many folks 
were already using the {RForcecom} package to connect to Salesforce. In order 
to foster adoption and switching between the packages {salesforcer} replicates 
the functionality of many {RForcecom} functions so that you will only need to swap 
out `library(RForcecom)` for `library(salesforcer)` and still have 
production scripts perform as expected.

## RForcecom Removed from CRAN

As of June 9, 2021, the {RForcecom} package was removed from CRAN. You can still 
use it by installing from the archive, but we strongly recommend using 
{salesforcer} instead. The existing functionality in {RForcecom} has been further 
optimized within {salesforcer} and new functionality has been added too.

## Salesforce Requires MFA Which Prevents RForcecom Basic Auth Log in

Basic authentication (password and security token) will no longer work since
Salesforce announced that all customers will be migrated to MFA beginning
February 1st, 2022
([link](https://admin.salesforce.com/blog/2021/everything-admins-need-to-know-about-the-mfa-requirement)).
As a result, the basic authentication routine used {RForcecom} and the legacy, 
compatibility method written into {salesforcer} will no longer work. Please migrate
to {salesforcer} and use `sf_auth()` to generate an OAuth 2.0 token. The examples
below will no longer work.

## Authentication

{salesforcer} supports OAuth 2.0 authentication which is preferred, but for 
backward compatibility provides the username-password authentication routine 
implemented by {RForcecom}. Here is an example running the function from 
each of the packages side-by-side and producing the same result.

First, authenticate and load any required packages for your analysis.

```{r auth-background, include = FALSE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(dplyr)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(here)))
library(salesforcer)
token_path <- Sys.getenv("SALESFORCER_TOKEN_PATH")
sf_auth(token = paste0(token_path, "/salesforcer_token.rds"))
```

```{r load-package, eval=FALSE}
library(salesforcer)
sf_auth()
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

# Beginning February 1, 2022, basic authentication will no longer work. You must
# log in to Salesforce using MFA (generating an OAuth 2.0 token typically from 
# the browser).

# the RForcecom way
# RForcecom::rforcecom.login(username, paste0(password, security_token), 
#                            apiVersion=getOption("salesforcer.api_version"))
# replicated in salesforcer package
session <- salesforcer::rforcecom.login(username, 
                                         paste0(password, security_token), 
                                         apiVersion = getOption("salesforcer.api_version"))
session['sessionID'] <- "{MASKED}"
session
```

Note that we must set the API version here because calls to session will not
create a new `sessionId` and then we are stuck with version 35.0 (the default from
`RForcecom::rforcecom.login()`). Some functions in {salesforcer} implement API
calls that are only available after version 35.0.

## CRUD Operations

"CRUD" operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) in the {RForcecom} package
only operate on one record at a time. One benefit to using the {salesforcer}
package is that these operations will accept a named vector (one record) or an
entire `data.frame` or `tbl_df` of records to churn through. However, rest
assured that the replicated functions behave exactly the same way if you are
hesitant to making the switch.

Here is an example showing the reduction in code of using {salesforcer} if you 
would like to create multiple records.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
n <- 2
new_contacts <- tibble(FirstName = rep("Test", n),
                       LastName = paste0("Contact-Create-", 1:n))

# the RForcecom way (requires a loop)
# rforcecom_results <- NULL
# for(i in 1:nrow(new_contacts)){
#   temp <- RForcecom::rforcecom.create(session, 
#                                       objectName = "Contact", 
#                                       fields = unlist(slice(new_contacts,i)))
#   rforcecom_results <- bind_rows(rforcecom_results, temp)
# }

# the better way in salesforcer to do multiple records
salesforcer_results <- sf_create(new_contacts, object_name="Contact")
salesforcer_results
```

## Query

{salesforcer} also has better printing and type-casting when returning query
result thanks to features of the {readr} package.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
this_soql <- "SELECT Id, Email FROM Contact LIMIT 5"

# the RForcecom way
# RForcecom::rforcecom.query(session, soqlQuery = this_soql)

# the better way in salesforcer to query
salesforcer_results <- sf_query(this_soql)
salesforcer_results
```

## Describe

The {RForcecom} package has the function `rforcecom.getObjectDescription()`
which returns a `data.frame` with one row per field on an object. The same
function in {salesforcer} is named `sf_describe_object_fields()` and also has
better printing and datatype casting by using tibbles.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# the RForcecom way
# RForcecom::rforcecom.getObjectDescription(session, objectName='Account')

# the better way in salesforcer to get object fields
result2 <- salesforcer::sf_describe_object_fields('Account')
result2
```
