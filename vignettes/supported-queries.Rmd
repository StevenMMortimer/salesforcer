## Overview

The following vignette outlines the different types of queries that have been 
documented and tested. These are the "supported" query types that the {salesforcer} 
package currently handles. If you run into an issue, please submit the issue 
[HERE](https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/salesforcer/issues/new?assignees=StevenMMortimer&labels=&template=query-issue-template.md&title=) 
in the GitHub repository so that we can fix or add your query type to this list. 
Thank you!
  
**Note**: Salesforce's proprietary form of SQL called SOQL (Salesforce Object
Query Language) is a powerful tool that allows you to return the fields of
records in almost any object in Salesforce. This includes standard objects like
Accounts, Contacts, and Tasks along with any custom objects and custom fields
created in your Org. You are encouraged to use Bulk APIs when:

  - You anticipate returning 10,000 records or more
  - Your query does not involve a parent-to-child nested relationship query
  - You would like to reduce the overall number of API calls to your Org
  
If you are not familiar with SOQL, then please consider reading the following

## Authentication

First, load the {salesforcer} package and login. There are two ways to authenticate: 
1) OAuth 2.0 (SSO) and 2) Basic Username-Password. It is recommended to use OAuth 
2.0 so that passwords do not have to be embedded in scripts or environment variables. 
By default, OAuth 2.0 stores the user's credentials in a locally cached file 
entitled ".httr-oauth-salesforcer" in the current working directory and will be 
refreshed automatically when the session expires.

```{r auth, include = FALSE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(dplyr)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(here)))
library(salesforcer)
token_path <- Sys.getenv("SALESFORCER_TOKEN_PATH")
sf_auth(token = paste0(token_path, "/salesforcer_token.rds"))
```

```{r load-package, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(salesforcer)
sf_auth()
```

## Default query behavior

The default API for the `sf_query()` function is the REST API because it is both
fast and flexible. Every effort has been made so that the format of the results
from the REST and SOAP APIs is exactly the same. The only difference will be
speed. The REST API uses JSON, which can generally be processed more quickly
than XML used in the SOAP API.

```{r query-records}
soql <- "SELECT Id,
                FirstName, 
                LastName
         FROM Contact
         LIMIT 10"

queried_records <- sf_query(soql) # REST API is the default api_type
queried_records

queried_records <- sf_query(soql, api_type = "SOAP")
queried_records
```

## REST vs. SOAP API query performance test 

Below is a small example to roughly demonstrate the magnitude of the performance 
difference between the REST and SOAP APIs when querying 1,000 records.

**Setup performance test**

```{r setup-performance-test}
# create a new account 
# (if replicating, you may or may not have an external id field in your Org)
prefix <- paste0("APerfTest-", as.integer(runif(1,1,99999)))
new_account <- sf_create(
  tibble(
    Name = "Test Account For Performance Test", 
    My_External_Id__c = prefix,
    Description = paste0("This is a test account with 1,000 records for ", 
                         "testing the performance differences between the ", 
                         "SOAP and REST APIs.")
  ), 
  object_name = "Account"
)

# create and associate a thousand new contacts with that account
# (again, you may or may not have an external id field in your Org)
n <- 1000
prefix <- paste0("CPerfTest-", as.integer(runif(1,1,99999)), "-")
new_contacts <- tibble(FirstName = rep("Test", n),
                       LastName = paste0("Query-Vignette", 1:n), 
                       test_number__c = 999.9,
                       AccountId = rep(new_account$id, n),
                       My_External_Id__c=paste0(prefix, 1:n))
new_contacts_res <- sf_create(new_contacts, "Contact", api_type = "Bulk 2.0")
```

**Performance test**

```{r run-performance-test, message=FALSE}
qry <- function(api_type){
  sf_query(
    sprintf("SELECT Id, Name, Owner.Id, 
               (SELECT Id, LastName, Owner.Id FROM Contacts) 
            FROM Account
            WHERE Id = '%s'", 
            new_account$id), 
    api_type = api_type
  )
}
res <- microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  qry("REST"),
  qry("SOAP"),
  times = 5, 
  unit = "s"
)
res

suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(
  ggplot2::autoplot(res) + 
    ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(name="Time [seconds]", n.breaks=6)
))
```

As seen in the limited test above, the REST API can be anywhere from **4-6x** 
faster than the SOAP API for a query on 1,000 contact records associated with a 
single Account. Breaking up the number of records returned into smaller batches by setting 
`QueryOptions = list(batchSize = 200)` typically does not affect this result very 
much but it also depends on the number of fields in the query. For the REST API the 
default is 2,000 records per batch with a minimum of 200 and maximum of 2,000. 
For the SOAP API the default is 500 records per batch. For both APIs it is important 
to note that there is no guarantee that the requested batch size is the actual 
batch size. Changes are made as necessary to maximize performance. For example, 
the SOAP API states "batch size will be no more than 200 if the SOQL statement 
selects two or more custom fields of type long text". The REST API mentions that 
the limit imposed by Salesforce's app servers is around 20,000 characters which 
can cause batches to be smaller. In short, it's generally okay to use the default 
batch sizes since Salesforce may optimize over your specified batch size anyways.

## When to use the Bulk APIs for queries

A general rule of thumb for using the Bulk APIs (Bulk 1.0 and Bulk 2.0) for 
queries is anytime you need to retrieve more than 10,000 records. The main reasons 
to not use the Bulk APIs are twofold. First, they do not support complex 
relationship queries or aggregate queries. If you need to write a nested relationship 
or aggregate query involving a large number of records you may be tempted to use 
the REST API. However, it is recommended to perform two or more separate bulk 
queries that retrieve the records you need and then join or aggregate the results 
in R.

```{r unsupported-bulk-queries}
# nested relationship query 
# (supposed to return the id and first name of all contacts on each account)
try(
  sf_query(
    "SELECT Id, Name, 
      (SELECT Id, FirstName FROM Contacts)
    FROM Account",
    api_type = "Bulk 2.0"
  )
)

# aggregate query
# (supposed to return the count of contacts per account)
try(
  sf_query(
    "SELECT Account.Id, Count(Name) contacts_n
    FROM Contact
    GROUP BY Account.Id",  
    api_type = "Bulk 2.0"
  )
)
```

The two queries above were trying to pull all the contacts for each account and 
then get a count of how many contacts there are per account. If you have a lot 
of records, using the REST API to return these results may not be feasible. Even 
though the Bulk APIs cannot handle the same query, they can pull down massive 
amounts of data quickly. In this case you can pull down all of the Contact records 
and all of the Account records and then perform the calculation using **dplyr**, 
like so:

```{r}
contacts <- sf_query("SELECT Id, FirstName, Account.Id
                     FROM Contact", 
                     api_type = "Bulk 2.0")

accounts <- sf_query("SELECT Id, Name 
                     FROM Account", 
                     api_type = "Bulk 2.0")

nested_query_recs <- accounts %>% 
  left_join(contacts %>% 
              rename(`Contact.Id` = Id, 
                     `Contact.FirstName` = FirstName), 
            by = c("Id" = "Account.Id"))
nested_query_recs

aggregate_query_recs <- nested_query_recs %>% 
  group_by(Id) %>%
  summarize(.groups = 'drop', 
            contacts_n = sum(!is.na(Contact.Id)))
aggregate_query_recs
```
  
The second reason to not use the Bulk APIs is that there is a performance overhead 
associated with every bulk (asynchronous) job that involves checking the status 
of the job until it succeeds or fails before retrieving the results. 

The example below is provided so that you can take this code as an example to 
run your own performance test of queries that return 10K, 100K, 1M+ records to 
see where the Bulk APIs outperform the REST API.

```{r run-performance-test2, eval=FALSE}
qry_compare <- function(api_type){
  soql <- sprintf("SELECT Id, LastName, Account.Id, Account.Name, Owner.Id
                   FROM Contact
                   WHERE Account.Id = '%s'", 
                   new_account$id)
  sf_query(soql, api_type = api_type)
}

res <- microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  qry_compare("REST"),
  qry_compare("Bulk 1.0"),
  qry_compare("Bulk 2.0"),
  times = 5, 
  unit = "s"
)
```

Note that the Bulk 1.0 API requires users to specify the target object along with 
their submitted SOQL. This is because it is needed when creating the bulk job that 
will manage and execute the query. 

```{r}
queried_records <- sf_query(soql, api_type = "Bulk 1.0")
```

As you can see above the {salesforcer} package will try to infer the object in 
the query if not explicitly provided. If it does not guess correctly, then please 
specify.

**Cleanup after performance tests**

By keeping track of the account ids used in our tests, it is fairly easy to find 
and delete these test records from our Org to save space.

```{r cleanup-performance-test}
# cleanup performance test Contact records ...
contacts_to_delete <- sf_query(
  sprintf("SELECT Id 
          FROM Contact 
          WHERE Account.Id = '%s'",
          new_account$id)
)
sf_delete(contacts_to_delete$Id, "Contact", api_type="Bulk 2.0")

# ... and finally delete the account
sf_delete(new_account$id)
```

## Relationship queries

Salesforce supports retrieving fields from related objects when querying another 
object. This is similar to performing a JOIN in SQL, but without having to specify 
the join keys because Salesforce already knows the relationship between the two 
objects. There are two types of relationship queries (1. child-to-parent lookups 
and 2. parent-to-child nested queries) detailed in the sections below.

### child-to-parent "lookup" queries

The first type of relationship query and the most common is child to parent. For 
example, the Contact object (child) to their parent, the Account object. In order 
to pull down parent object fields with your child record query, you just need to 
prefix any fields from the related object by concatenating the name of the 
object with the field name separated by a period. In the example below we are 
retrieving all Contact object records that have a relationship to an Account.

```{r}
# child-to-parent relationship (e.g. Account.Name from Contact record)
sf_query(
  "SELECT Id, FirstName, Account.Name
  FROM Contact
  WHERE Account.Id != null"
)
```

Sometimes you may notice that the requested relationship fields do not appear in
the query results. This is because the SOAP and REST APIs do not return any
related object information if it does not exist on the record and there is no
reliable way to extract and rebuild the empty columns based on the query string. 
In the example below, if there were Account information an additional column
titled `"Account.Name"` would appear in the results. 

```{r}
# child-to-parent relationship (e.g. Account.Name from Contact record)
sf_query(
  "SELECT Id, FirstName, Account.Name
  FROM Contact
  WHERE Account.Id = null"
)
```

Note, that the Bulk 1.0 and Bulk 2.0 APIs will return `"Account.Name"` as a
column of all `NA` values for this query because they return results
differently. 

Finally, one aspect to note is that the Bulk 2.0 API does not support 
child-to-parent-grandparent relationships as seen in the example below:

```{r}
try(
  sf_query("SELECT Id, FirstName, Account.Owner.Id
            FROM Contact", 
           api_type = "Bulk 2.0")
)
```

### parent-to-child "nested" queries

Instead of "looking up" a related field, users can write queries that retrieve the 
individual records related to a parent. For example, if you would like all of the 
Accounts and their Contacts you can write the query like so: 

```{r}
sf_query(
  "SELECT Id, Name, 
    (SELECT Id, FirstName FROM Contacts)
  FROM Account"
)
```

At first glance this query may appear the same as a lookup query on the Contact object 
that includes the account id and name. However, the small difference is that every 
Account is included, regardless of whether or not they have a Contact. This can be 
helpful when you want to ensure a query contains all of the parent records and their
child records, if they exist. Also, note that the plural object name is used inside 
the nested query ("Contacts" instead of "Contact"). 

Finally, a parent-to-child nested query can also contain a child-to-parent lookup 
relationship within it. Below is an example where the Owner Id on the Contact is 
included so you can know who is responsible for the Contacts under each Account.

```{r}
sf_query(
  "SELECT Name, Owner.Id, 
    (SELECT Id, FirstName, Owner.Id FROM Contacts)
   FROM Account"
)
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are having an issue with a query please submit in the {salesforcer} GitHub 
repository at: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/salesforcer/issues">https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/salesforcer/issues</a>. As a maintainer, queries are tough to debug because every Salesforce 
Org is unique. Custom objects or relationships created in your Salesforce Org may 
be different or even impossible to test in another Org. When filing your issue please 
make an attempt to understand the query and debug a little bit on your own. Here 
are a few suggestions:  

  1. Slightly modify your function call to `sf_query()` to observe the results. Here 
  are a few prompting questions that may assist you:  
  
      - What do you see when you set `verbose=TRUE` argument?
      
      - What happens if you change the `control` argument, specifically the batch size? 
      
      - What happens if you try using a different API (e.g. "SOAP" vs "REST" or "Bulk 1.0" vs "Bulk 2.0")?
      
      - What happens if you change your query slightly? 
      
      - Do you need a parent-to-child nested relationship query or will a child-to-parent lookup suffice? 
    
  2. Check out Salesforce's Workbench tool to see how it constructs specific 
     queries that you are debugging. The tool is available at
     `https://workbench.developerforce.com` and requires a Salesforce login 
     (the same credentials as you normally would use).
  
  3. Double check Salesforce's <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql.htm">SOQL reference guide</a> to see whether your query is supported or limited in some way.
  
  4. Review query unit tests at: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/salesforcer/blob/main/tests/testthat/test-query.R">https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/salesforcer/blob/main/tests/testthat/test-query.R</a>. 
  These unit tests were written to cover a variety of use cases and to track any 
  changes made between newly released versions of the Salesforce API (typically 
  4 each year). These tests are an excellent source of examples that may be 
  helpful in troubleshooting your own query.
  
  5. Roll up your sleeves and dive into the source code for the {salesforcer} 
  package. The main scripts to review are:
