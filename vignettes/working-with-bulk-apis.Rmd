## Using the Bulk API

First, load the {salesforcer} and {dplyr} packages and login, if needed. 

```{r auth, include = FALSE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(dplyr)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(here)))
library(salesforcer)
token_path <- Sys.getenv("SALESFORCER_TOKEN_PATH")
sf_auth(token = paste0(token_path, "/salesforcer_token.rds"))
```

```{r load-package, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(salesforcer)
sf_auth()
```

For really large inserts, updates, deletes, upserts, and queries you can just add 
`api_type = "Bulk 1.0"` to most functions to get the benefits of using the Bulk API 
instead of the SOAP or REST APIs. The change you have to make from using the REST 
API to the Bulk 1.0 API as simple as adding `api_type="Bulk 1.0"` to your function 
arguments. First, let's build a `tbl_df` with two new records to be created.

```{r}
n <- 4
prefix <- paste0("Bulk-", as.integer(runif(1,1,100000)), "-")
new_contacts <- tibble(FirstName = rep("Test", n),
                       LastName = paste0("Contact-Create-", 1:n),
                       My_External_Id__c=paste0(prefix, letters[1:n]))
```

There are some differences in the way the REST API returns response information vs. 
the Bulk 1.0 API. However, the changes in Salesforce are exactly the same for these 
two calls.

```{r}
# REST
rest_created_records <- sf_create(new_contacts[1:2,], 
                                  object_name="Contact", 
                                  api_type="REST")
rest_created_records

# Bulk
bulk_created_records <- sf_create(new_contacts[3:4,], 
                                  object_name="Contact", 
                                  api_type="Bulk 1.0")
bulk_created_records
```

## A Complete Bulk API Workflow

To show a more lengthy example of using the Bulk 1.0 API, below is a workflow of 
that creates 2 records, queries them, and deletes them. This is just an example. 
Typically, you'd want to use the Bulk APIs over the REST or SOAP APIs when dealing 
with over 10,000 records.

```{r, include=FALSE}
n <- 2
prefix <- paste0("Bulk-", as.integer(runif(1,1,100000)), "-")
new_contacts <- tibble(FirstName = rep("Test", n),
                       LastName = paste0("Contact-Create-", 1:n),
                       My_External_Id__c=paste0(prefix, letters[1:n]))
```
```{r}
object <- "Contact"
created_records <- sf_create(new_contacts, object_name=object, api_type="Bulk 1.0")
created_records

# query bulk
my_soql <- sprintf("SELECT Id,
                           FirstName, 
                           LastName
                    FROM Contact 
                    WHERE Id in ('%s')", 
                   paste0(created_records$Id , collapse="','"))

queried_records <- sf_query(my_soql, object_name=object, api_type="Bulk 1.0")
queried_records

# delete bulk
deleted_records <- sf_delete(queried_records$Id, object_name=object, api_type="Bulk 1.0")
deleted_records
```

## Query Limitations

There is one limitation to Bulk queries is that it does not support the following 
operations or structures of SOQL: 

 - COUNT
 - ROLLUP
 - SUM
 - GROUP BY CUBE
 - OFFSET
 - Nested SOQL queries
 - Relationship fields
 - Compound address fields
 - Compound geolocation fields
 
## Using the Bulk 2.0 API
 
Salesforce has more recently introduced the Bulk 2.0 API which is supposed to be 
faster and have a more consistent JSON/REST based API than the Bulk 1.0 API. In 
some cases I have noticed that the ordering of the result records will differ 
from the order of the input data because the data is batched and processed asynchronously. 
by Salesforce instead of R. However, The Bulk 2.0 API returns every single field
that was included in the call so if you have an identifying key your dataset,
then it should not be a problem to join on that key with your original data to
bring in the newly assigned Salesforce Id that is generated when the record was 
created in Salesforce. However, I have find it just seems wasteful to transfer 
all of the field information back after the query and have not found a significant
performance improvement between the Bulk 1.0 and Bulk 2.0. Finally, note that 
the status field names ("Success", "Created", "Error") are different from the 
Bulk 2.0 API.

```{r}
n <- 20
prefix <- paste0("Bulk-", as.integer(runif(1,1,100000)), "-")
new_contacts <- tibble(FirstName = rep("Test", n),
                       LastName = paste0("Contact-Create-", 1:n),
                       test_number__c = 1:n,
                       My_External_Id__c=paste0(prefix, letters[1:n]))

created_records_v1 <- sf_create(new_contacts[1:10,], 
                                object_name = "Contact", 
                                api_type = "Bulk 1.0")
created_records_v1

created_records_v2 <- sf_create(new_contacts[11:20,],
                                object_name = "Contact", 
                                api_type = "Bulk 2.0")
created_records_v2
```

## Performance Benchmarks for Bulk Queries

Below is a simple performance benchmark between the Bulk 1.0 and Bulk 2.0 
APIs for a small query. In general, the Bulk 2.0 should be faster. One potential 
reason for the implementation in R to be faster is that the entire recordset is 
parsed at once from a downloaded CSV of the results when using the Bulk 1.0 API. 
The Bulk 2.0 retrieves the same data in large batches (typically 50,000 records 
at a time). I would encourage users to experiment to see what works best in their 
Salesforce Org.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
soql <- "SELECT Id, Name FROM Contact"
bulk1_query <- function(){sf_query(soql, "Contact", api_type="Bulk 1.0")}
bulk2_query <- function(){sf_query(soql, api_type="Bulk 2.0")} # Bulk 2.0 doesn't need object name

res <- microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  bulk1_query(),
  bulk2_query(), 
  times=8, 
  unit = "s"
)
res

suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(
  ggplot2::autoplot(res) + 
    ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(name="Time [seconds]", n.breaks=6)
))
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
sf_delete(c(created_records_v1$Id, created_records_v2$sf__Id), 
          object_name = "Contact", api_type="Bulk 2.0")
```
