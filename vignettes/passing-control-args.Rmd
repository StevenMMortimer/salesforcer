If you're inserting records from R you may want to turn off the assignment rules 
or even bypass duplicate rules and alerts to save records. Beginning in Version 0.1.3 of 
the {salesforcer} package many functions have a `control` argument that will allow 
you to fine tune the behavior of calls to the Salesforce APIs. This vignette will 
introduce the different options you can control and how to pass them into the {salesforcer} 
functions you're already familiar with.

## The new control argument

This new feature can be seen in the `sf_create` (and many other functions) as 
`control=list(...)`. The dots mean that you can pass any number of controls directly 
into the function. 

```{r auth, include = FALSE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(dplyr)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(here)))
library(salesforcer)
token_path <- Sys.getenv("SALESFORCER_TOKEN_PATH")
sf_auth(token = paste0(token_path, "/salesforcer_token.rds"))
```

First, authenticate and load any required packages for your analysis.

```{r load-package, eval=FALSE}
library(salesforcer)
sf_auth()
```

In the example below, we demonstrate how to create a record, but use the control 
arguments to prevent its creation from showing up in the Chatter feeds by setting 
the `DisableFeedTrackingHeader`.

```{r sample-create}
new_contact <- c(FirstName = "Jenny", 
                 LastName = "Williams", 
                 Email = "jennyw@gmail.com")
record1 <- sf_create(new_contact,
                     object_name = "Contact",
                     DisableFeedTrackingHeader = list(disableFeedTracking = TRUE))
record1
```

You will notice that the argument `DisableFeedTrackingHeader` can be included
right into the function without any documentation existing for it in the
`sf_create` function. This is because the dots (`...`) allow you to pass over a
dozen different control parameters and that documentation would be tedious to
create and maintain over multiple functions in the package. However, you will
notice in the documentation entry for the `control` argument there is a link to
a function called `sf_control` which you can use to directly to pass into
`control` or simply to review its documentation of all the possible control
parameters and their defaults. This is where you can review the various control
options in more detail before trying to set them.

You may have also noticed that the argument <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_header_disablefeedtracking.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DisableFeedTrackingHeader</a> was
formatted as a list with an element inside called `disableFeedTracking` set to
`TRUE`. This may seem redundant but there are two reasons for this. First, this
is exactly how the Salesforce APIs documents these options, which are typically
referred to as "headers" because they are passed as a named header of the HTTP
request and then the header fields and values are provided for that header.
Second, some headers have multiple fields and values so a list is the only way
to provide multiple named fields and values under a single header entity.

## An example using the `DuplicateRuleHeader`

The `DuplicateRuleHeader` that controls whether the duplicate rules are 
followed when inserting records from the API, has three fields: 

 1. `allowSave` - For a duplicate rule, when the Alert option is enabled, bypass 
 alerts and save duplicate records by setting this property to true. Prevent 
 duplicate records from being saved by setting this property to false.
 
 2. `includeRecordDetails` - Get fields and values for records detected as
 duplicates by setting this property to true. Get only record IDs for records 
 detected as duplicates by setting this property to false.
 
 3. `runAsCurrentUser` - Make sure that sharing rules for the current user are 
 enforced when duplicate rules run by setting this property to true. Use the sharing 
 rules specified in the class for the request by setting this property to false. 
 If no sharing rules are specified, Apex code runs in system context and sharing 
 rules for the current user are not enforced.
 
Specifying these arguments requires a `list` structure in R, which may seem redundant 
in some cases, but is necessary to follow in order to build the API request correctly. 
 
```{r sample-create-w-duplicate}
# override the duplicate rules ...
record2 <- sf_create(new_contact,
                     object_name = "Contact",
                     DuplicateRuleHeader = list(allowSave = TRUE, 
                                                includeRecordDetails = FALSE, 
                                                runAsCurrentUser = TRUE))
record2

# ... or succumb to the duplicate rules
record3 <- sf_create(new_contact,
                     object_name = "Contact",
                     DuplicateRuleHeader = list(allowSave = FALSE, 
                                                includeRecordDetails = FALSE, 
                                                runAsCurrentUser = TRUE))
record3
```

Per the description above, note that setting `allowSave=TRUE` will not override 
rules where the "Action on Create" for a rule is set to "Block". If the 
duplicate rule's action is "Allow" with an alert, then setting `allowSave=TRUE` 
means the record will be created with no warning message. If `allowSave=FALSE`, 
then the record will be prevented from being created. For additional information 
on the `DuplicateRuleHeader`, please see the Salesforce documentation at: 
<a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_header_duplicateruleheader.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_header_duplicateruleheader.htm</a>

Finally, you may notice during your use that only certain control arguments are 
permitted based on the API. For example, the `DuplicateRuleHeader` is not implemented 
in the REST API like it is in the SOAP API. In the example below you should take 
note of two things: 

 1. When using the REST API and setting the `DuplicateRuleHeader`, then you will 
 notice a warning that the header was ignored. You will receive warnings when 
 trying to set any control parameters for an API or operation that does not 
 recognize that particular control.
 
 2. In this example, you cannot bypass the duplicate rule alert to create the 
 record if using the REST API like you can with the SOAP API. 

```{r sample-create-w-warning}
record4 <- sf_create(new_contact,
                     object_name = "Contact",
                     DuplicateRuleHeader = list(allowSave = FALSE, 
                                                includeRecordDetails = FALSE, 
                                                runAsCurrentUser = TRUE),
                     api_type = "REST")
record4
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
deleted_records <- sf_delete(c(record1$id, record2$id))
```

## Creating the control argument with sf_control

If this type of control structure is new to you, take a look at the documentation for 
the `glm` and `glm.control` functions. The way these two functions behave is exactly how 
functions like `sf_create` and `sf_control` work with each other. As demonstrated above 
you can pass any number of arbitrary controls into the function and they are all 
gathered up into the control by `control = list(...)`. However, you can specify the 
control directly like this: 

```{r sample-query}
sf_query("SELECT Id, Name FROM Account LIMIT 1000",
         object_name = "Account",
         control = sf_control(QueryOptions = list(batchSize = 200)))
```

## Backwards compatibility for all_or_none and other named arguments

You may already be taking advantage of the `all_or_none` or `line_ending` arguments 
which are control arguments that were explicity included in functions. These argument 
essentially hard coded values to pass the `AllOrNoneHeader` and `LineEndingHeader` 
control parameters. Starting with the 0.1.3 release it is no longer necessary and 
preferable not to have an argument like `all_or_none` listed explicity as an argument 
since it can be provided in the `control` argument. Note: the `all_or_none` argument 
and other explicit control arguments will still be available in {salesforcer} 0.1.3
but will provide a deprecated warning. They will be removed in the next CRAN release 
of the package so it will be important to update your code now if you are explicitly 
passing these arguments and see a deprecation warning.
  
## Reference Links

Below is a list of links that go directly to the control arguments (a.k.a headers) 
for the different APIs. I highly recommend reading this documentation before setting 
a control parameter in R so you know exactly what the behavior will be and how to 
specify it in R. You may notice that some controls are not included in the R package. 
Some may be added in the future if requested and some will not be added given the 
scope of the package. One final note is that some arguments in the REST API, like the 
"All or None" behavior is not a header, but a parameter in the API call. For this reason 
you will not see it listed in the REST API Headers section, but it is set in this R package 
using the `AllOrNoneHeader` argument in `sf_control` just to provide consistency between 
the SOAP and REST APIs. It would be confusing to have two arguments named differently, 
one for each API, but to do the exact same thing from R. For this reason, many of the 
control arguments match exactly as they are listed in the SOAP API, but can be used 
across other APIs even if not exactly written that way in the Salesforce documentation 
referenced below.
